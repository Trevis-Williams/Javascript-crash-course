    <p>How this works?</p>
    <script>
        let cars = ["honda", "jeep", "chevy"]
        for (let number of cars ){
            console.log(`There are these type of brands avaible ${number}`);
            if( number === "honda"){
                console.log(`You are in a honda!!!`)
            }
        };

<!-- By chaning the temprale litarle to number instead of cars it 
 will go through each one of th eoptionsin th earray. Assinge it a number then print it to the console  -->

 <!-- If I change the temrale litirale to cars it will print the whole array. 
 The reason this is happeing is beccause the temprale litrale is the whole veriable. 
 Unlike number it doesnt assine each string in the array a value -->
